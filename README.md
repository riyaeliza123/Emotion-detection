# Abstract
WHO notes that, with 1.7 nurses per 1,000 people, India falls short of their recommended rate of 3 nurses per 1,000 people and that, in order to comply with WHO standards by 2024, the nation will require 4.3 million more nurses.  To tackle this, we  suggest a novel system; being an AI-based emergency monitoring system that would enable real-time surveillance and instantly detect changes in comfort by detecting real-time facial expressions, to warn medical personnel and emergency contacts. This would optimize the problem of rigorous training of nurses and aid them to give adequate attention to patients. 

As a result, our system will accurately identify faces, evaluate sentiment, and alert the healthcare division to view the patient's situation.
